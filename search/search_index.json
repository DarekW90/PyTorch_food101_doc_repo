Thank you for entering here. To be honest I am not realy sure what shoud I leave here in index page so at the top there are links to other sections of this simple project.</p> <p>Thank you and enjoin!</p>"},{"location":"about/","title":"About me","text":"<pre><code>...precise...\n...stubborn...\n...obstinate...\n...striving for a goal...\n</code></pre> <p>That only few of my character traits...</p> <p>Hey! My Name is Darek im 33y.o. (yeap... I'm from a previous century, even a millennium) so far I was an electrician, construction worker and recently a CNC machine operator and now I've decided to say stop to my current professional development and go for artificial intelligence development.</p> <p>Why? Why not? I want to do something big, companies what I been works so far, was quite cool, but they were keeps me in bay... I want to progress myself, so I choose to become AI Developer in soon future.</p> <p>For last 6 months I've been working so hard for my current state and for last 2 months I've tried hard with PyTorch bootcamp. I hope I'm ready to start first job as machine learning programmer. Few days ago I have finished this course, and this is my first ever program. I know... its simple... but gimme some time more, gimme practice, gimme job... And I promice soon I'll be lots better.</p> <p>Ok. That's enough. We can talk later if you only want to. Just let me know, I am happy to hear any feedback.</p>"},{"location":"code/","title":"Code and experiments","text":""},{"location":"code/#for-full-code-see-github","title":"For full code see \u27a1 GitHub","text":""},{"location":"code/#experiments-completed-with-this-model","title":"Experiments completed with this model:","text":"<p>Both experiments are done on ViT_B_16 pretrained model </p>"},{"location":"code/#experiment_1-train-on-20-of-total-data","title":"Experiment_1: Train on 20% of total data","text":""},{"location":"code/#experiment_2-train-on-100-of-total-data","title":"Experiment_2: Train on 100% of total data","text":""},{"location":"code/#summary","title":"Summary:","text":"<p>As can bee see most wrongs predictions for photos are these food which almost looks the same.</p>"},{"location":"code/#note","title":"Note:","text":"<pre><code>For this setup its not worth to run such big dataset on that little ammount of epochs, \nprobably when learning will go for longer (more epochs) \ntime then Loss could be lower and Accuracy higher.\n\nAs can be seen Loss curve still going down so probably if I could do 10 or 15 epochs more,\nthen curves could be realy close, also Accuracy curve keeps going up.\n</code></pre> <p>Unfortunetly I am unable to do longer test becouse of long learning time limited compute times in GoogleColab / Kaggle I don't want to waste more compute time for this project, in my opinion it is better if I keep them for other practices.</p>"},{"location":"demo/","title":"Demo \ud83e\udd17","text":"<p>For full interactive demo site see \u27a1 HuggingFace</p> <p>Hey!
